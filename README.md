# Samples for Semantic Kernel v1 proposal

This repo demonstrates what AI apps may look like once v1 of Semantic Kernel is complete.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Now that the .NET version of Semantic Kernel is available, we are no longer updating these proposals. Please refer to the
> Semantic Kernel's [syntax examples](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/tree/main/dotnet/samples/KernelSyntaxExamples) or the documentation on [learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview/) to see how to use the V1 APIs in .NET.

## Structure of repo

- ~~dotnet - .NET 6 samples~~
  - ~~samples – sample apps using proposed v1 API~~
    - ~~01-SimpleChat – simple chat bot~~
    - ~~02-PersonaChat – chat bot with a custom persona~~
    - ~~03-SimpleRag – chat bot that performs basic RAG~~
    - ~~04-DynamicRag – chat bot that performs dynamic RAG~~
    - ~~05-MultiModal – examples of using different models and modality types with Semantic Kernel~~
    - ~~06-Assistants – demonstrates how to use assistants with Semantic Kernel~~
  - ~~src – "hacks" to make the proposal "work"~~
- [python](./python) - Python samples
  - [samples](./python/samples) - sample apps using the proposed v1 API
    - [01-SimpleChat](./python/samples/01-SimpleChat) – simple chat bot
    - [02-PersonaChat](./python/samples/02-PersonaChat) – chat bot with a custom persona
    - [03-SimpleRag](./python/samples/03-SimpleRag) – chat bot that performs basic RAG
    - [04-DynamicRag](./python/samples/04-DynamicRag) – chat bot that performs dynamic RAG
  - [src](./python/src) – "hacks" to make the proposal "work"

Additional samples (and hacks) will be provided for the Java versions of Semantic Kernel.
